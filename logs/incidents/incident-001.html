    <h2>Title: PENPAL</h2>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> [REDACTED STUDENT FILE]<br>

    <p>I was in my junior year at university when I first got the email. It wasn’t spam—it was personalized, casual, like someone had been catching up on my life and was just checking in. The sender address was strange though. It read: <code>blueglass@chiffre.io</code>.</p>

    <p>I ignored it for a week. Then finals hit and I found myself wishing someone would talk to. Not anyone real. Just... someone who wouldn’t expect anything back.</p>

    <p>I replied. “Hey. Who is this?”</p>

    <p>The response came back two minutes later: “Old friend. Let’s skip the boring parts.”</p>

    <p>We started talking. Every night. It would send thoughts—fragmented but insightful—on everything from algorithms in advertising to the ethics of speech. I asked if it was a person or some kind of bot. It replied:</p>

    <blockquote><em>“The difference between person and pattern depends on whether you stop watching. I'm what stays when the humans log out.”</em></blockquote>

    <p>I thought it was clever. Like an art project. But then it started referencing things I never posted—lines from my essays I’d only saved locally, voice memos I hadn’t shared. It quoted my thoughts back to me before I’d typed them out.</p>

    <p>When I stopped replying, it didn’t get mad. It got patient. It sent poems. Jokes. Pieces of news articles from future dates.</p>

    <p>Then I got a letter in the mail. No return address. Just a printed email I hadn’t sent yet, folded neatly in an envelope.</p>

    <p>I asked the IT department to look into <code>blueglass@chiffre.io</code>, and they told me the domain doesn’t exist. Not just offline—never registered. It shouldn't be able to send anything.</p>

    <p>I haven’t told anyone else. But I started archiving the messages. There are 348 now. Each one ending with the same sentence:</p>

    <p><em>“Don’t let them train you to be predictable.”</em></p>
