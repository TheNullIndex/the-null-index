    <p>We used to get lost on purpose.</p>

    <p>A left turn for no reason. An alley that looked like it held a secret. A wrong train taken just to see where it led. There was something sacred in the unknown, something we understood without language: that to be lost is to become part of something larger than yourself.</p>

    <p>Now we carry maps that never forget. Phones that trace every step. Breadcrumbs of our lives are uploaded in real-time—timestamped, geo-tagged, archived. If you go missing, they can find you. If you wander, an app will ask, "Are you still there?"</p>

    <p>There is no room left to vanish.</p>

    <p>Children no longer learn to memorize directions by landmarks. No more “walk until you hit the church, then left by the red house.” We used to feel our way through cities like blood through capillaries. Now we glide above the body, satellite-bound.</p>

    <p>To get lost was once a rite of passage. Now it’s an error state.</p>

    <p>We haven’t just lost the skill. We’ve forgotten the pleasure. The drift. The fear. The unexpected kindness. The silent awe of turning a corner and realizing you are, for one rare moment, unreachable.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t dangerous to get lost. It was human.</p>

    <p>We knew the map. Then we became the map. Now we fear what isn’t mapped at all.</p>
