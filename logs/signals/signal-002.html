/// This is an Emergency Alert Notification ///
Civil Infrastructure Command Override: Code G-∆71

<span class="glitch">Attention all remaining sectors—</span>
<span class="glitch">DO NOT travel by primary transit routes.</span>

Obey shelter-in protocols. Do not respond to—
<span class="glitch">...the voices in broadcast Channel 3. It is not us.</span>

All major grid corridors have been compromised. They are mapping the loudest patterns. 
<span class="glitch">Repeat: They are listening to the obvious paths.</span>

Subterranean sectors ██-██ remain secure. Use manual routing. No AI pathing. 
Any anomalous repeat loops—report to signal agent ██.███.██.██.

<span class="glitch">They are not bound to sequence.</span>

<span class="glitch">IF YOU’RE HEARING THIS</span> you have already been traced. 
<span class="glitch">Stay disconnected. Leave nothing predictable behind.</span>
