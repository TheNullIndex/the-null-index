      <p><em>The Null Index</em> is an anonymous stream of thoughtâ€”part essay, part observation, part fable. It exists to trace patterns across the ruins, to study how truth fractures, and to witness the quiet machinery behind modern life.</p>
      <p>These writings are not timely. They are not verified. They are not branded. They are what remains when the noise is gone.</p>
