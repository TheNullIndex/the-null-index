    <h1>Observation 002: On the Nature of Watching</h1>
    <p><em>Filed under: Observation</em></p>

    <p>The camera is always on, but it’s not always recording. Or maybe it is. The distinction no longer matters. Surveillance is ambient now—not only from institutions but from ourselves. We have accepted the omnipresence of watchers in exchange for convenience, security, and attention.</p>

    <p>But what is the cost of being watched, continuously? What behavioral residue does it leave behind? Every choice is now an echo of visibility—curated, filtered, compressed into a legible signal for some invisible feed.</p>

    <p>The strange part is not that we’re watched. It’s that the watchers are increasingly artificial, nonhuman, disinterested in narrative or intent. They don’t see us, they index us.</p>

    <p>What does it mean to live under that kind of gaze?</p>
