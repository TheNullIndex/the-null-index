    <h2>The Thursday That Lasted Three Days</h2>

    <p><strong>Temporal Signature:</strong> Repeating anomaly<br>
       <strong>Reported by:</strong> Local civilian observation, flagged by internal agent</p>

    <p>It started with a strange kind of fatigue. Not exhaustion—just a dragging sense that time itself had been stretched thin. Everyone I talked to said the same thing:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>“Feels like it’s still Thursday.”</em><br>
      <em>“Wasn’t it Thursday yesterday?”</em><br>
      <em>“Wait… it’s Thursday again?”</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Thursday, March 13th. That date is written in at least six formats across my apartment—on receipts, browser history, a scribbled post-it. But the timestamps don’t agree. Some clocks advanced normally, while others logged events repeatedly. Photos taken during this time include objects or people that shouldn’t be there—duplicates of earlier moments, like echoes that failed to fade.</p>

    <p>I remember Friday. I swear I remember Friday. Grocery trip, rain, a conversation I had that couldn’t have happened on a Thursday. But my phone's calendar, my smart home’s logs, and even my dreams all rewound. No Friday files exist.</p>

    <p>Even worse, during the final Thursday—the third one—I noticed something off in the sky. The clouds were identical to the first Thursday. The same configuration, drifting in the same patterns. On a whim, I played an ambient livestream from a mountaintop webcam. The sky there was frozen. The timestamp refreshed. The image did not.</p>

    <p>Then, sometime past what should have been Friday evening, everything resumed. Saturday arrived like nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>Except… I don’t trust Saturdays anymore.</p>

    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This may not be a case of time repeating, but perception of time decoupling. Some reports suggest the “reset” Thursdays diverged on microscopic detail—bird calls, TV reruns, personal moods. If true, this may be a proximity-based chrono-fracture rather than a full cycle.</p>
